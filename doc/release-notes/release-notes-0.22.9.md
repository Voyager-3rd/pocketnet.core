  <https://github.com/pocketnetteam/pocketnet.core/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Pocketcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or just copy over `pocketcoind`/`pocketcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Pocketnet Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Pocketnet Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
=============

Pocketnet Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux 20+ (and clones like Mint Linux, etc.), macOS 10.15+ and
Windows 7 and newer. Pocketnet Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but
is not as frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Pocketnet Core on
unsupported systems.
